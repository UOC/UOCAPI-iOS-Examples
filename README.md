## Introduction

Here you will find some examples of how to call the UOC API. Please note that these are just examples, they are not designed to be perfect or to be released for commercial use.

There is exactly one example for every call to the API as well as one example of how to open an app from another app (ExempleApp2App) and an example of an iOS library for UOC API which contains three usage examples (Exemple Llibreria). All projects are named like the API call they represent.

* If you are interested in the library, you should look the most recent one. You can find it [here][GitHubLlibreria].

## How to use

* Step 1: Download this repository.
* Step 2: Open one of the projects with Xcode. (for example calendarEventsGet.xcodeproj in Exemple CalendarEventsGet folder).
* Step 3: Run the code on the iPhone Simulator.
* (Optional) Step 4: Use the code for your own project.

## ToDo

Update all UI to iOS 7 

Delete or comment all Logs from the code
